      <h2>Creating Impact, One Step at a Time</h2>
      <p>Through these key programs, we are working to uplift the most vulnerable in our communities:</p>

      <h3>📘 Education Support</h3>
      <p>We provide learning materials, school fees, and tutoring support to children in need.</p>

      <h3>🛠️ Skills Training</h3>
      <p>We organize vocational training in areas such as sewing, farming, carpentry, and entrepreneurship to help youth and women become self-sufficient.</p>

      <h3>💧 Health & Wellness</h3>
      <p>Our initiatives include clean water access, hygiene kits, and community health education to improve daily life.</p>

      <h3>🏫 Future Goal: A Full School</h3>
      <p>We aim to build a school with a library, a safe hostel, and a fun playground — a sanctuary of hope for underprivileged children.</p>
